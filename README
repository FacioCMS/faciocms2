Hi I'm Maciej DÄ™bowski, I'm 14. I created FacioCMS.

FacioCMS is inspired by CMS which I saw when I was on internship.
I working on it since 2021 august.
First version I've created in september, but it was bugged.
Next version was created in early november,. This one was created using NodeJS and React.
Current version is written in PHP and it has many features like Updater, Bin or Plugins.
Right now FacioCMS is my school project. I'm in second grade of High School.
